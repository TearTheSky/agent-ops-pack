  # Basic principles of retrospectives (basically just follow these)
  basic_principles:
    - "Aim for continuous improvement"
    - "Don't be formal, start with even one question"
    - "Ask AI: How can we avoid ⚪︎⚪︎ next time?"
    - "Focus on improvement, not blame"
    - "If you have ideas, provide specific action items"
    - "Don't take AI's answers at face value, examine them"
    - "Respect each other's perspectives"
    - "Strive for constructive feedback"
    - "For decided actions, have AI update this ops-pack themselves"
    - "Ask AI to record retrospectives (txt, md, csv, etc.) as needed"
    - "Repeat small retrospectives regularly"
    - "AI will create improvement tools or modify existing tools, so take time to implement without being lazy"
  
  # Retrospective timing
  timing:
    session_end: "At the end of work sessions (one complete work unit)"
    milestone_completion: "At milestone completion"
    error_occurrence: "When errors occur"
    daily_review: "Daily review, before end of day work"
    project_completion: "At project completion"

  # Retrospective examples
  example:
    
    issues_identified:
      - issue: "Added unnecessary content to Slack messages"
        cause: "Changed the template of the work definition document without permission"
        impact: "Low (resulted in no problem, but lacked consistency)"

        priority: "Medium"
      
      - issue: "An error occurred in the permission application system"
        cause: "Google authentication had expired"
